# My-Projects
This file contains all the projects i have made till date using the best of my knowledge. 

Project-1 "Iot Based Patient Monitoring System"
Patients are facing a problematic situation of unforeseen demise due to the specific reason of heart problems and attack which is because of nonexistence of good medical maintenance to patients at the needed time. This is for specially monitoring the old age patients and informing doctors and loved ones. So, we are proposing an innovative project to dodge such sudden death rates by using Patient Health Monitoring that uses sensor technology and uses internet to communicate to the loved ones in case of problems. 


Project-2 "IOT Based Agriculture Monitoring System"
